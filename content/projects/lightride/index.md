Fun prototype mixing a lot of elements of basic 2D games, including consistent physics, hidden objects, and platformer-esque gameplay (I know its not a platformer.. but the lights are kinda like platforms!).

Made in Unity3D i.e. even though Unity is always Unity3D but converts the space to 2D, this was leveraged in mesh renderings and object design (no sprites)
### Instructions
Click the lamps or lightswitches to move the ball, try and get it to the goal!

You can mess with the sliders at the bottom for volume settings.
