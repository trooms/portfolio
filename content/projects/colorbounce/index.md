First "finished" game I've made. Made in a prototyping course. Fun arcade type game that seems like it exists before, but I don't think it does. Let me know if you find a clone!
### Instructions
You can use the spacebar to play (that's how the original game was), the left/right was mostly intended for mobile but obviously its tough to do in the browser.
